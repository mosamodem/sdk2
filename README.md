MEGA SDK - Client Access Engine
===============================

Building
--------

    sh autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


Usage
-----

A simple project in `doc/example` shows how to use the MEGA SDK
in your applications.  In order to compile and link your
application with the MEGA SDK library, you can use the `pkg-config` script:

    g++ $(pkg-config --cflags libmega) -o lsmega.o -c lsmega.cpp
    g++ $(pkg-config --libs libmega) -o app lsmega.o

An (almost) feature complete console-based client application can be found
in `examples`. Similar to an FTP client, it allows you to invoke and test
the client library's full functionality.


Platform Dependencies
---------------------

The following notes are intended for building and running build
artifacts.


### POSIX (Linux/Darwin/BSD/...)

Install the following development packages, if available, or download
and compile their respective sources (package names are for
Debian and RedHat derivatives respectively):

* Crypto++ (`libcrypto++-dev`, `cryptopp-devel`)
* cURL (`libcurl-dev`, `curl-devel`)

CAUTION: Verify that the installed `libcurl` uses c-ares for
asynchronous name resolution.  If that is not the case, compile it
from the original sources with `--enable-ares`.  Do *NOT* use
`--enable-threaded-resolver`, which will cause the engine to get
stuck whenever a non-cached hostname is accessed. Also, bear in mind
that not enabling asynchronous DNS resolving at all would result in
the engine losing its non-blocking behaviour.

Filesystem event monitoring: Under Linux, inotify is used; periodic full
directory scans otherwise.

To build the the reference megacli example, you may also need to install:

* GNU Readline (`libreadline-dev`, `readline-devel`)
* FreeImage (`libfreeimage-dev`, `freeimage-devel`)
* SQLite (`libsqlite3-dev`, `sqlite-devel`)

Please ensure that your terminal supports UTF-8 if you want to see and
manipulate non-ASCII filenames.


### Windows

To build the client access engine under Windows, you'll need to following:

* A Windows-native C++ development environment (e.g. MinGW or Visual Studio)
* Crypto++
* zlib (until WinHTTP learns how to deal with Content-Encoding: gzip)

(You won't need cURL, as megaclient's Win32 version relies on WinHTTP
for network access. Windows-native filesystem event monitoring is
implemented.)

To build the reference megacli.exe example, you will also need to procure
development packages (at least headers and .lib/.a libraries):

* FreeImage
* GNU Readline/Termcap
* SQLite

CAUTION: The megaclient example is currently not handling Unicode
input/output correctly if run in cmd.exe.

Filename caveats: Please prefix all paths with `\\?\` to avoid the following
issues:

* The `MAX_PATH` (260 character) length limitation, which would make it
impossible to access files in deep directory structures

* Prohibited filenames (`con`/`prn`/`aux`/`clock$`/`nul`/`com1`...`com9`/`lpt1`...`lpt9`).
Such files and folders will still be inaccessible through e.g. Explorer!

Also, disable automatic short name generation to eliminate the risk of
clashes with existing short names.


### Folder syncing

In this version, the sync functionality is severely limited in scope and
functionality:

* There is no locking between clients accessing the same remote folder.
Concurrent creation of identically named files and folders can result in
server-side dupes.

* Syncing between clients with differing filesystem naming semantics can
lead to loss of data, e.g. when syncing a folder containing `ABC.TXT` and
`abc.txt` with a Windows client.

* Local filesystem items must not be exposed to the sync subsystem more
than once. Any dupes, whether by nesting syncs or through filesystem links,
will lead to unexpected results and loss of data.

* No in-place versioning. Deleted remote files can be found in
//bin/SyncDebris, deleted local files in the client machine's recycle bin.

* No delta writes. Changed files are always overwritten as a whole, which
means that it is not a good idea to sync e.g. live database tables.

* No direct peer-to-peer syncing. Even two machines in the same local subnet
will still sync via the remote storage infrastructure.
